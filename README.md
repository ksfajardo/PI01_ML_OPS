## Introduction 
<p align="justify">
This is my MLOps project for the Data Science career at the Soy Henry academy. </br>

This project leverages data from a comprehensive movies dataset, comprising information such as movie titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and more. It utilizes different techniques in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and API development to deliver accurate movies recommendations.
</p>

## Objective
The primary objective this project is to develop and deploy a content-based movie recommendation system by leveraging data from a comprehensive movies dataset. 
The project aims to achieve the following specific objectives:
- Data Transformation and Cleansing: Apply Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) techniques to preprocess and cleanse the movies dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis to gain insights into movie attributes such as title, overview and genres. Identify key features that significantly influence movie preferences and uncover patterns that can be leveraged for accurate recommendations (I chose myself as target audience so this part of the project might be kind of biased). 
- API Development: Design and implement a set of functions and an API that seamlessly integrate with the content-based recommendation system.
- Recommendation Generation: Develop a machine learning model that utilizes content-based filtering techniques and similarity scores to recommend movies with similar attributes to the one given by the user.
- API Deployment: Deploy the recommendation system's API in a production environment, ensuring it is available and accessible to users. Implement appropriate scaling mechanisms to provide a seamless user experience.
- MLOps Best Practices: Establish an efficient MLOps infrastructure.

## Scope
The project was developed following these key aspects:
- Data Preprocessing: [ETL link](https://github.com/ksfajardo/PI01_ML_OPS/blob/main/ETLPI01.ipynb)
- API Functions Development: [API Functions Development link](https://github.com/ksfajardo/PI01_ML_OPS/blob/main/FuncionesAPI.ipynb)
- Exploratory Data Analysis: [EDA link](https://github.com/ksfajardo/PI01_ML_OPS/blob/main/EDA_ML.ipynb)
- Machine Learning Model Development: [Machine Learning Development link](https://github.com/ksfajardo/PI01_ML_OPS/blob/main/MLmodel.ipynb)
- API Development: [API Repository](https://github.com/ksfajardo/PI01_ML_OPS_API) (This is located in a different repository here in my github but this is purely to keep an order for myself)
- API Deployment: [API Deploy](https://moviesapp-oxeinkhcia-uc.a.run.app) (You can add "/docs" at the end of the link to go to the automatic documentation FastAPI creates)
